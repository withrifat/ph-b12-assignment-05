### 3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?  
**Answer:**  
Event bubbling is a process of going to the root from the last child of the DOM tree.  
It works branch by branch. For example, if I want to get a particular parent element then I have to go through all its corresponding children. I have to trigger one child to get its parent, then another one to get the parentâ€™s parent, and so on.

### 4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?  
**Answer:**  
Event Delegation in JavaScript is a process of getting all the children elements by adding one single event listener to the parent element. It works by the event bubbling process.  
It is useful because it lets us write less code by decreasing the number of event listeners. So it improves performance as it has less code.
